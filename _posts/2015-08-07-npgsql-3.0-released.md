Npgsql 3.0.0 is out and available at nuget.org.

Npgsql 3.0.0 is a near-total rewrite, and represents over a year's effort.

* Switch to 100% binary communication with PostgreSQL [#447](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/447).
  This has the following advantages:
  * Significant speed increase for some types
  * Improves general stability and removed dependency user-defined parameters such as
    `DateStyle`, `extra_float_digits`, `lc_monetary` etc. (see
    [#514](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/514),
    [#324](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/324),
    [#163](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/163),
    etc.)
  * More consistent behavior between simple and prepared statements
  * Simplified codebase (we previously supported both text and binary codecs for most types)
* True async support for NpgsqlReader for better scalability.
  This implements the new .NET 4.5
  [ADO.NET async methods](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh211418%28v=vs.110%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396),
  *except* for the async connection methods (these are a major goal for 3.1, see
  [#379](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/379)).
* Reworked type handing that greatly reduces memory churn. Except your application to allocate and release much less
  memory than before.
* New high-performance import/export API that exposes PostgreSQL COPY. See
  [the docs](http://www.npgsql.org/doc/copy.html) for more details.
* Much better support for PostgreSQL asynchronous operations, such as LISTEN/NOTIFY.
  See [the docs](http://www.npgsql.org/doc/continuous-processing.html) for more details.

There are many other changes, [see here](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A3.0) to get an idea.

Note that Npgsql 3.0 *is not a simple drop-in replacement for 2.2*: there are some breaking changes involved.
Please consult the [migration guide](http://www.npgsql.org/doc/migration-3.0.html) and test extensively before deploying to
production.

Major goals for Npgsql 3.1 includes:

* Complete async support for connections ([#379](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/379))
* Fully implement the Entity Framework 7 provider (already in progress,
  [#279](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/249))
* Support .NET Core ([#471](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/471))
* Full, native PostGIS support ([#529](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/529))

Please try it out and let us know immediately of any issues!
