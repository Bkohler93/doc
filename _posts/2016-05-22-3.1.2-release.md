Npgsql 3.1.2 has been released and is available on nuget.org.

This release fixes a major bug where the read timeout was set incorrectly, resulting in
incorrect timeout exceptions.

Also, async calls weren't really executed asynchronously when using SSL (TlsClientStream
specifically), this has been resolved and async calls will be truly async.

All users of 3.1.x should upgrade immediately.
