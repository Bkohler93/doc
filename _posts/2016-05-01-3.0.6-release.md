Npgsql 3.0.6 is out and available at nuget.org.

This release fixes numerous bugs, including one that could cause pooled connections to "leak" under certain
load conditions ([#1019](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/1019)). Thanks to
[@shortspider](https://github.com/shortspider) for raising and fixing the issue.

An additional issue related to Npgsql's internal query parser was fixed
([#946](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/946)). Note that as a result, parameter names can no longer 
start with a digit - this could cause breakage if you were using parameter names such as `:1`.

Is is strongly recommended that everyone upgrade. The full list of changes is
[available here](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues?q=milestone%3A3.0.6).
