Npgsql 3.1.5 and the Entity Framework Core 1.0.0 have been released and are available on nuget.org.

Both versions target .NET Core RTM (1.0.0), which was released a few days ago. This is the EFCore provider's
first stable release, although it probably hasn't been battle-tested yet - please report all issues on
[the EFCore provider repo](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL). To get started,
follow the instructions in [the EFCore docs](ef.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). You can also find some info
on Npgsql-specific features and unsupported features on [the Npgsql EFCore page](http://www.npgsql.org/doc/efcore.html).

The complete list of issues [for Npgsql 3.1.5 is here](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues?q=milestone%3A3.1.5).
