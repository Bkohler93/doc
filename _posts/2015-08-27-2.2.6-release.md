Npgsql 2.2.6 is out and available at nuget.org.

This is a maintenance release for the 2.x branch which fixes some bugs, including a potential SQL injection issue
when using citext or other exotic types (see [#734](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/734)). Note that
this bug doesn't affect the 3.x branch and there's no need to upgrade.

The 2.x is considered obsolete and will only be maintained to fix critical bugs. You are encouraged to (cautiously!)
upgrade to 3.x as soon as possible.

The full list of changes is [available here](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues?q=milestone%3A2.2.6+is%3Aclosed+).
