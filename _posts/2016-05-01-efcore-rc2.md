Npgsql's Entity Framework Core (previously EF7) provider has been synced up with EFCore rc2.

The package has been renamed Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL and is available in the
Npgsql [unstable feed](http://myget.org/gallery/npgsql-unstable). Continuous integration
is set up (mostly) and will ensure that as development continues new packages will be
available.

Please report any issues you find on https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL.
