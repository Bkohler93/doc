The first beta version of Npgsql 3.1.0 is out and available on nuget.org.

This version represents 9 months of work since the release of 3.0.0, and is a significant release
touching many areas of Npgsql. It includes some breakage documented in the
[migration notes](../doc/3.1/migration.html) and should be tested carefully.

Please try it out and let you know how it works for you! Release highlights are below, the documentation
isn't yet up to date on everything.

* CoreCLR support (netstandard13). Some known issues will be fixed for 3.1.0 but things should already work pretty well.
* Fixed multi-statement commands issues ([#641](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/641)).
  You can now send commands with statements that depend on each other, such as "CREATE TABLE X ...; INSERT INTO X..."
* The connection pool has been rewritten from scratch and many previous performance issues should be gone
  ([#726](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/726)).
* NpgsqlConnection's OpenAsync() is now truly async, ([#379](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/379)).
  and Open() is now fully sync ([#709](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/709)).
* Native binary support for PostGIS 2D types, thanks @rossini-t ([#665](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/pull/665)).
* Composite type support (*document*)
* Exception behavior has been improved and made more compatible with other ADO.NET providers. It's now easier to
  catch exceptions Npgsql throws ([#897](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/897)).
* When mapping enum or composite types, you can now control how field names are mapped to PostgreSQL names
  ([#859](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/859)).
* Continued efforts from 3.0 to reduce heap allocations - Npgsql 3.1 should place even less pressure on the garbage collector.
