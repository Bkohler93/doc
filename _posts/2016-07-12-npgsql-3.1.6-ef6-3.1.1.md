Npgsql 3.1.6 and the Entity Framework Core 3.1.6 have been released and are available on nuget.org.

Npgsql 3.1.6 is a minor bug release that mainly fixes the incorrect nuget ID accidentally published in 3.1.5
(npgsql instead of Npgsql).
[The complete list of issues is here](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues?q=milestone%3A3.1.6).

EF6.Npgsql 3.1.1 is a fix for [#27](https://github.com/npgsql/EntityFramework6.Npgsql/issues/27), which broke some complex
queries (mainly inheritance-related).
