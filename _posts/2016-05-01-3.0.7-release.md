Npgsql 3.0.7 is out and available at nuget.org.

This release undoes change [#946](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/946), which made it illegal to
start parameter names with digits. While this fixed an SQL parsing issue, it causes too much breakage for
ORMs and existing code which uses parameter names such as @1. An alternative fix,
[#1056](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/1056), has been applied instead in 3.0.7 - you
can use parameter names with digits as before.
