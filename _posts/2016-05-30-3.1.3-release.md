Npgsql 3.1.3 has been released and is available on nuget.org.

This release fixes some important issues:

* PostgresException now properly inherits from NpgsqlException
  ([#1117](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/1117)).
* When executing big multistatement commands, `ConfigureAwait(false)` was missing.
  This could lead to deadlocks in some cases, even when using synchronous I/O.
  ([#1136](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/1136)).
* Because of the new composite type support in 3.1, initial connections to database
  with a large number of tables could be very slow. This is now fixed.
  ([#1126](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/1126)).

All users of 3.1.x should upgrade immediately.
