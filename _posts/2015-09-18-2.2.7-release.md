Npgsql 2.2.7 is out and available at nuget.org.

This is a maintenance release for the 2.x branch which fixes
[a bug when creating a database with Entity Framework 6](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/565).
Note that this bug has already been fixed in the 3.x branch.

The 2.x is considered obsolete and will only be maintained to fix critical bugs. You are encouraged to (cautiously!)
upgrade to 3.x as soon as possible.
