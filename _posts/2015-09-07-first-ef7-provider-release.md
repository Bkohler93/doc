title:  "First Entity Framework 7 Provider Release"

An experimental Npgsql Entity Framework 7 provider is available for testing.
Note that like EF7 itself the provider is under heavy development, but most of the basic features work.

Try it out and let us know how it goes! Installation instructions can be found
[in the docs](../doc/ef7.html).
