Npgsql 3.1.8 and the Entity Framework Core 1.0.2 have been released and are available on nuget.org.

Npgsql 3.1.8 contains two important deadlock fixes that could occur when performing synchronous operations
on the thread pool, one which caused thread pool exhaustion when opening
([#1232](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/1232)) and another with multistatement commands
([#1256](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/1256)).

In addition, some performance optimizations have been made which should make pooled connection open
work much faster.

The complete list of issues [is here](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/milestone/36?closed=1).

The Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL 1.0.2 fixes some issues and depends on the latest versions of
Entity Framework Core and Npgsql.

The complete list of issues [is here](https://github.com/npgsql/Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL/milestone/4?closed=1).
