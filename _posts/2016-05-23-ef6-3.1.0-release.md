Npgsql's Entity Framework 6 (and 5) provider version 3.1.0 has been released and is available on nuget.org.
This allows use of the newly-released Npgsql 3.1.0 with Entity Framework 6/5.

Starting now, EF6/5 provider releases will be decoupled from Npgsql itself; up to now every time a version
bump occured on Npgsql, an EF6/5 provider with the same version released. From now on each project will
follow its own versioning.
