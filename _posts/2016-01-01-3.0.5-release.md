Npgsql 3.0.5 is out and available at nuget.org.

This release that could affect users setting MinPoolSize > 1.
See issue [#918](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/918).

Also, when closing a pooled connection that had an active transaction, that transaction would not be rolled back
immediately. This could cause issues and has been fixed - transactions are rolled back immediately upon close.
See issue [#927](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/927).

Note that NpgsqlConnection's `DataSource` property now returns a URL (e.g. tcp://localhost:5432). Code that relied
on the contents of `DataSource` is probably now broken. See issue [#903](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/903).

Npgsql 2.2 had a Windows installer that would set up Npgsql in the GAC and update your `machine.config` file - this
installer has been revived and will now be released with 3.x version
(check our [releases tab on Github](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/releases).
Note that in most use cases, Npgsql should *not* be installed into the GAC - use Nuget instead.
See the [installation page](http://www.npgsql.org/install.html) for more details.

Is is strongly recommended that everyone upgrade. The full list of changes is
[available here](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues?q=milestone%3A3.0.5).

Happy new year 2016!
