# Npgsql 5.0 (Preview)

Npgsql 5.0 is currently in development, and previews are occasionally published to nuget.org. If you'd like to try out a nightly build, you can use [the unstable feed](http://www.npgsql.org/doc/installation.html#unstable-packages).

## Breaking changes

* The *TcpKeepAliveTime* and *TcpKeepAliveInterval* connection string parameters are now expressed in seconds instead of milliseconds.
